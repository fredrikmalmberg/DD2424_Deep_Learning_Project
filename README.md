# DD2424 Deep Learning In Data science - Project
Image colorization project for DD2424 Deep Learning in Data science at KTH. <br>
This is an attempt on reproducing the experiment and result from the paper [Colorful Image Colorization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.08511.pdf).<br>
The original data set can be retrieved from [ImageNet](http://www.image-net.org/download-imageurls "Original source") or the [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/imagenet-object-localization-challenge/data)
